* Be able to represent ports scanned by scanners as binary features using One Hot Encoding
* Be able to apply k-means clustering to cluster the scanners based on the set of ports they scanned.
* Be able to identify the set of top k ports for one-hot encoding ports scanned.
* Be able to interpret the results of clustering using cluster centers.
* After successful clustering of the small Darknet dataset, conduct clustering on the large Darknet dataset (running spark in cluster mode).
* Be able to evaluate the result of k-means clustering (cluster mode) using Silhouette score and Mirai labels.
* Be able to use .persist() and .unpersist() to improve the scalability/efficiency of PySpark code.
